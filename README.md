# Purobot Event Timeline

![Repository icon](icon.png)

Version 1.0.4 is a HACS packaging release. Backend Python logic is unchanged from the recovered working package. Manifest metadata now identifies this repository and its version.

## Install or migrate

1. Back up Home Assistant, including the existing configuration and event history.
2. Add `https://github.com/jpark40/ha-purobot-timeline` in **HACS > three dots > Custom repositories**, type **Integration**. Download it.
3. Keep the existing `purobot_timeline:` block in `configuration.yaml`. For a fresh installation, merge `examples/configuration.yaml` at top level once. Do not paste a duplicate block.
4. Restart Home Assistant. This integration uses YAML setup; no new UI configuration flow is introduced.
5. Manage the matching card through `jpark40/ha-custom-dashboards`. The backend repository does not install JavaScript into `/config/www`.

HACS updates the same `/config/custom_components/purobot_timeline` directory. Do not uninstall the working integration before migrating. Event history remains in the directory configured by your existing YAML, outside the integration source. HACS does not move or delete it.

Existing APIs and service names remain unchanged. For original configuration details, see `LEGACY-INSTALLATION.md`; its manual JS installation instructions are superseded by the shared dashboard bundle.

## Updates and releases

Install an available update through HACS and restart HA. Keep `VERSION` and `custom_components/purobot_timeline/manifest.json` in agreement. Run **Actions > Publish release > Run workflow** on `main` to validate and publish the current version. Increase the version before subsequent releases.

This repository contains one integration, as required by HACS. It is intended to be added as a custom repository; default-catalog submission is separate.

## Icons

The repository contains a custom icon in 256px and 512px PNG, with editable SVG source. For integrations, `brand/icon.png` and `brand/icon@2x.png` are bundled inside the integration; Home Assistant 2026.3+ can display these local brand images.

HACS currently uses its external brands source for integration list icons; the open upstream issue https://github.com/hacs/integration/issues/5223 prevents local-only brand assets from reliably appearing there. Dashboard repositories use HACS's generic Dashboard category icon rather than a per-repository custom icon. The artwork is visible in each repository README and is included for supported HA surfaces. No unsupported icon field is added to hacs.json.
